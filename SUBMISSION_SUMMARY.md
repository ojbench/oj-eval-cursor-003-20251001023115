# ICPC Management System - Submission Summary

## Implementation Overview

Successfully implemented an ICPC Management System in C++ with the following features:

### Core Functionality
- **Team Management**: Add teams with O(log N) lookup using map data structure
- **Submission Tracking**: Record and process submissions with proper status handling
- **Scoreboard Ranking**: Efficient ranking based on:
  1. Number of solved problems (descending)
  2. Penalty time (ascending)
  3. Solve times comparison (max to min, lexicographically)
  4. Team name (lexicographical)
- **Freeze/Scroll Operations**: Proper handling of frozen problems with correct unfreezing logic
- **Query Operations**: 
  - Query team ranking with frozen status warnings
  - Query submissions with flexible filtering

### Optimizations
- Solve times kept sorted in descending order for O(M) comparison instead of O(M log M)
- Efficient scoreboard updates using O(N log N) sorting
- Avoided repeated sorting by maintaining invariants

### Local Testing Results
- All provided test cases (1-7, small, error) pass successfully
- Larger test cases (big) pass within reasonable time limits
- Implementation handles edge cases correctly

## Submission History

1. **Attempt 1-3**: Compilation errors due to incorrect repository URL and binary files in git
2. **Attempt 4**: Compilation error (suspected C++17 compatibility issue)  
3. **Attempt 5**: Used C++14 standard for better compatibility
   - Submission ID: 684701
   - Status: Pending evaluation (as of last check)

## Final Repository State
- Clean codebase with only source files
- Proper .gitignore for build artifacts
- Simple Makefile using C++14 standard
- All commits properly documented

## Submission ID for Tracking
- **Submission ID**: 684701
- Check status with: `python3 submit_acmoj/acmoj_client.py status --submission-id 684701`
